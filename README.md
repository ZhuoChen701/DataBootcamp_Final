# DataBootcamp_Final
This repository contains the final project for NYU ECON_UB_232 Data Bootcamp, which focuses on building predictive models to forecast Premier League football match outcomes (Win, Draw, Loss) using pre-match statistics. The task is framed as a multiclass classification problem and addresses class imbalance challenges using appropriate metrics and modeling strategies. Four different machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and a tuned Neural Network—were implemented and evaluated using macro F1-score as the primary metric. The neural network model ultimately delivered the best balance of performance across all outcome classes. This project showcases how predictive analytics can be applied in sports to support decision-making, evaluation, and strategy.
