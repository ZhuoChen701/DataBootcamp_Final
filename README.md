# DataBootcamp_Final --- Predicting Premier League Match Outcomes
This repository contains the final project for NYU ECON_UB_232 Data Bootcamp. The project explores predictive modeling to forecast Premier League football match outcomes (Win, Draw, or Loss) using pre-match team statistics.
Framed as a multiclass classification problem, the project tackles class imbalance and evaluates models using macro-averaged F1-scores. Four machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and a tuned Neural Network—were implemented and compared. Among them, the Neural Network model achieved the best overall balance across outcome classes. This project demonstrates how predictive analytics can be applied to support decision-making, evaluation, and strategy in sports.
